# Feynman Pi

A dashboard application that would help farmers connect to the market, with prices (current, average, all time lowest, all time highest) of different item/goods they produce.

## Working
- Buyers push their demand to the market : item they need, the weight, and the max price they can afford.
- The backend route handles the request, and calculates the new current, average, lowest, and highest prices accordingly.
- One backend route send the all the information, including the item and its different prices.
- The frontend receives the response and display it to the farmers.
